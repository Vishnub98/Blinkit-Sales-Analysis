Blinkit Grocery Sales Analysis Across Tier 1, 2, and 3 Cities in India


In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of grocery sales for Blinkit across various city tiers in India. The goal was to identify sales trends, customer preferences, and market opportunities within Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities. Using data visualization tools like Power BI and Excel, I explored key metrics such as sales volume, popular product categories, and regional performance. This analysis provides valuable insights to enhance marketing strategies and optimize inventory management tailored to different urban demographics.
Join me in exploring how data can drive smarter decisions in the grocery sector!
